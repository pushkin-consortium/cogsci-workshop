                    The proliferation of web-connected devices has presented
                    significant opportunities and challenges to cognitive science
                    — opportunities in that cognitive scientists can collect
                    data relevant to human cognition orders of magnitude faster
                    than before, addressing questions that were otherwise impossible
                    to address; and challenges in that cognitive scientists
                    require new infrastructure to collect these data and new methods
                    to analyze them once collected.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This workshop brings together cognitive scientists who are
                    at the forefront of these opportunities and challenges in scaling
                    cognitive science, along with cognitive scientists who
                    would like to be, to engage in a day of interactive exchange
                    and development of ideas related to scaling cognitive science.
                    Each presentation addresses a different opportunity or challenge.
                    One set of presentations highlights opportunities. A second set
                    highlights challenges of statistical analysis and data collection.
                    In a break-out session, attendees address these opportunities and
                    challenges head on.

                    <p>
                        Joshua Hartshorne is an assistant professor of psychology at
                        Boston College, where he directs the Language Learning Laboratory
                        Hartshorne is interested in understanding what allows
                        humans, but not current machines, to learn language —
                        and why it is that children, despite their salient limitations of
                        both cognition and experience, are so much more successful
                        at language learning than adults. Hartshorne is particularly
                        interested in applying new and emerging methods (such as
                        computational modeling and crowdsourcing) to core problems
                        in the language sciences.

                    <p>
                        Hartshorne will introduce the workshop by discussing
                        opportunities and challenges associated with scaling cognitive
                        science. Hartshorne will discuss these challenges in the
                        context of running GamesWithWords.org, a web-based research
                        laboratory that has tested hundreds of thousands of
                        participants in a variety of experiments on language and cognition.
                        Hartshorne will also discuss Pushkin, a platform for
                        running large-scale online experiments.

                        at the University of Minnesota, where she collaborates with
                        researchers, museum professionals, volunteers, and other developers
                        to create crowdsourced citizen-science research projects
                        with Zooniverse. Simenstad has a B.A. in cognitive science
                        from Carleton College.

                    <p>
                        Simenstad will discuss Zooniverse. Zooniverse is the
                        world’s largest and most popular platform for crowdsourced
                        citizen-science research, with more than 1,000,000 volunteers.
                        The goal of the Zooniverse organization is to enable
                        research that would not be possible, or practical, otherwise.
                        Zooniverse research results in new discoveries, datasets useful
                        to the wider research community, and many publications.

                        Todd Gureckis is a professor at New York University,
                        where he runs the Cognition and Computation lab. The goal
                        of the lab’s research is to better understand the memory,
                        learning, and decision processes which allow humans to
                        carry out intelligent and adaptive behaviors.

                    <p>
                        Gureckis will discuss scaling brain data through behavior.
                        One goal of computational cognitive neuroscience is to
                        infer the relationship between latent variables in a cognitive
                        model and particular features of brain data (e.g., fMRI or
                        EEG). Typically, the precision of this relationship is constrained
                        by the amount of brain data that can be collected
                        (e.g., the number of subjects in a fMRI study). In this talk,
                        Gureckis will leverage ideas from the statistics literature on
                        inference with missing data and hierarchical modeling to explore
                        how one can potentially learn more about a neuroimaging
                        signal by collecting only additional behavioral data.

                        James Houghton is a doctoral candidate at the MIT Sloan

                    <p>
                        Houghton will discuss the Empirica platform in the context
                        of his research on social contagion. Social contagion research
                        has for decades explored the effect of social network
                        structure on the adoption of a single belief or practice. However,
                        new theoretical models show that interaction between
                        diffusants has a strong influence on their patterns of adoption.
                        Houghton will present an experimental design called the ‘detective
                        game’ for studying the diffusion of interacting beliefs
                        in a controlled setting, explaining how an online laboratory
                        experiment handles the confounds of pre-existing biases and
                        meanings while cost-effectively achieving the scale necessary

                        Josh Peterson is a postdoctoral fellow at Princeton University,
                        where he studies the relationship between the representations

                        Peterson will discuss scaling research on decision making
                        and categorization. Technological advances have made
                        it possible to observe human behavior at an unprecedented
                        scale, and the massive datasets that result provide two exciting
                        new tools for cognitive modeling. First, such datasets
                        serve as a test of the generalizability of our models and theories
                        and therefore have the potential to improve them. Second,
                        they offer the essential fuel for training machine learning
                        models. Peterson will present case studies within two of
                        the oldest modeling paradigms in cognitive science: categorization
                        and decision making.

                        Agrawal will discuss scaling studies of moral decision
                        making. Standard methods of exploratory data analysis are
                        vulnerable to noise in large datasets. To combat this problem,
                        he proposes a methodology called Scientific Regret Minimization,
                        which focuses on minimizing errors with respect to
                        the data that are predictable. Agrawal applies this methodology
                        to large datasets in the domains of moral reasoning and
                        economic choice, and demonstrates how this approach helps
                        build powerfully predictive (and interpretable) models and
                        identify interesting new phenomena.

                        on computational models of human learning, memory,
                        and decision-making. As part of DARPA’s Next Generation
                        Social Science program, Suchow led a team to develop <a

                        an online experimental platform for running behavioral
                        and social science experiments at the scales necessary
                        to understand emergent social phenomena.

                        Suchow will discuss Dallinger and associated techniques
                        for experiment design at scale.
